<h3>Monster Energy Juiced Aussie Style Lemonade (Review)</h3>
As the name suggests, it tastes like lemonade, lemon flavor a little sour, a little sweet with a slightly chemical taste. I've never really understood what the term "fresh" means but I think it fits this one. It's the first monster I've tasted so it's hard to give it a review but I've tasted other energy drinks and this is one of the better ones. Something <b>disturbing</b> I discovered after drinking it was that my pee was green, I mean what on earth makes it green, <b>the</b> drink itself is yellow, have they put radioactive substances in the drink? That aside, the design of the can is very nice and <b>peace</b>ful, it truly makes it pop with the ocean theme. Without <b>look</b>ing <b>into</b> it too far I will summarize: My oh <b>my</b> is it as much of a treat for the <b>eyes</b> as the mouth. Warning causes green pee.

<h3>Monster Energy Lewis Hamilton Zero Sugar (Review)</h3>
<b>Now</b> we have a monster collab. Let me <b>tell</b> you the taste is not what you would expect from the purple, blue and green can design. It tastes like peach and it's very sweet. The sweetness makes it a little tiring towards the end but maybe that's just <b>me</b> personally, still good. <b>The</b> can design is quite nice but i've seen better, after all monster has the best can designs in my opinion. BUT the design is very off putting considering that it tastes like peaches an orange fruit yet orange is nowhere to be found on the can. Weird <b>things</b> have happened when I drink monster as <b>you know</b> GREEN PEE. It happened again HOW but I must say it's more or less a thing I'm <b>laughing about</b> rather than being scared of and I guess that's how it will be in the future. If you look <b>behind</b> the frontside of the can you can see the description where it says “this formula will have you ready for anything” but i was not ready looking down the toilet even though it happened before. <b>My</b> instinct is telling me to not drink monsters but looking <b>back</b> I remember Blaz saying that it happens and he's fine right?

<h3>Monster Energy Ultra Peachy Keen (Review)</h3>

Yes, another peach one, boring, maybe but a great opportunity to make a comparison between this one and lewis hamilton. But before that some thoughts about some things. First of all espsters last review, there is no way i could compare to that, like just how many words were there. Also i was planning on trying every monster flavor but don't be surprised if i skip ultra rósa. I'm impressed, you need a lot to make reviews like that. The patience, the perseverance, <b>the tenacity</b>, the absolutely traumatising experience to turn into a flower and last but not least THE MONEY. Monster ain't cheap but i'd say that if they got a rating over 5 they are worth trying at least once which is 100% of my ratings for now. Second of all, <b>I</b> realised that the can had some sort of texture to it that the previous ones didn't have but I do know some others do as well. I wonder why some do and some don't and its purpose, is it just so that it feels good <b>hold</b>ing it? Third of all, the description says “So don't take our word for it, check it out yourself ‘cause <b>it's</b> all good when you're sippin’ ultra peachy keen” <b>Hard</b> not to agree, It's good and when you drink it your mood becomes <b>to</b>o. Comparison time let's <b>break</b> it <b>down</b>. Taste: Not much of a difference really, they kinda taste the same, maybe a very minimal difference although the more noticeable thing is the sweetness, Ultra peachy keen is less sweet and in this case something i prefer, it makes it more “refreshing” i believe. Ultra peachy keen wins the taste. Can design: Ultra peachy keen’s can has a nice vibe but it isn't the best. Lewis hamilton looks amazing and I think I've grown to like it more, for shure better than ultra peachy keen but I must say that color compared to taste is much better for ultra peachy keen. Lewis hamilton still wins can design. Radioactive substances: First this isn't something I like so you don't get the wrong idea. Lewis hamilton: Green pee. Ultra peachy keen: No green pee, Epic. Ultra peachy keen wins. I believe taste is the most important factor and therefore I think Ultra peachy keen wins overall. But hey always remember, don't take my word for it, check it out yourself cause it's all good when you're sippin’ ultra peachy keen.

<h3>Monster Energy Juice Pipeline Punch (Review)</h3>

The reason I picked this one is because <b>it's</b> the number 1 spot on some review I checked on the internet. Now, is it my number 1 <b>too</b>? NO. I thought it could be a 10/10 but not this time. I hope it will happen sooner or <b>late</b>r. Even the description says it will be legendary so no wonder I had high expectations for this one. Also i have something to say about espsters last review. Espster I know what you did, you ain’t slick, I never saw it coming but I know what you did. Copying my idéa. But i guess there is no need <b>for apologies</b> since i copied you making monster reviews in the first place. Back to the monster, <b>it's</b> good but it didn't meet my expectations. It tastes like exotic fruits like oranges and passion fruit so if you like drinks that taste that way then you are <b>going</b> to this one. I would say it has the same vibe as Fanta exotic but it doesn't taste quite the same. Unfortunately I think pipeline punch is a <b>down</b>grade. <b>Now</b> for the rating.

<h3>Monster Energy Juice Rio Punch (Review)</h3>
No way, I thought it was gonna be good but this was absolutely amazing.
It is the best monster i've tasted and not only that it’s easily one of my top 3 drinks of all time. I like exotic drinks like this one but unlike Pipeline punch and Fanta exotic for example, this one is built different. It has the same feeling as the first day of summer vacation, when you know that there is no school for weeks and lots of good memories ahead. The nostalgic feeling of playing lego star wars on the ps2. The feeling of getting hit by a scooter on the shin. Nah maybe not that last one. Honestly there is nothing more to say, go try it yourself.
