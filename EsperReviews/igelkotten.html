Igelkotten56 told me that he was heavily inspired by Espster reviews so we'll see how this plays out.

<h3>Monster Energy Juiced Aussie Style Lemonade (Review)</h3>
As the name suggests, it tastes like lemonade, lemon flavor a little sour, a little sweet with a slightly chemical taste. I've never really understood what the term "fresh" means but I think it fits this one. It's the first monster I've tasted so it's hard to give it a review but I've tasted other energy drinks and this is one of the better ones. Something <b>disturbing</b> I discovered after drinking it was that my pee was green, I mean what on earth makes it green, <b>the</b> drink itself is yellow, have they put radioactive substances in the drink? That aside, the design of the can is very nice and <b>peace</b>ful, it truly makes it pop with the ocean theme. Without <b>look</b>ing <b>into</b> it too far I will summarize: My oh <b>my</b> is it as much of a treat for the <b>eyes</b> as the mouth. Warning causes green pee.

<h3>Monster Energy Lewis Hamilton Zero Sugar (Review)</h3>
<b>Now</b> we have a monster collab. Let me <b>tell</b> you the taste is not what you would expect from the purple, blue and green can design. It tastes like peach and it's very sweet. The sweetness makes it a little tiring towards the end but maybe that's just <b>me</b> personally, still good. <b>The</b> can design is quite nice but i've seen better, after all monster has the best can designs in my opinion. BUT the design is very off putting considering that it tastes like peaches an orange fruit yet orange is nowhere to be found on the can. Weird <b>things</b> have happened when I drink monster as <b>you know</b> GREEN PEE. It happened again HOW but I must say it's more or less a thing I'm <b>laughing about</b> rather than being scared of and I guess that's how it will be in the future. If you look <b>behind</b> the frontside of the can you can see the description where it says “this formula will have you ready for anything” but i was not ready looking down the toilet even though it happened before. <b>My</b> instinct is telling me to not drink monsters but looking <b>back</b> I remember Blaz saying that it happens and he's fine right?
