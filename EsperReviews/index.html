<h3>Monster Energy Juiced Aussie Style Lemonade (Review)</h3>
If you're like anything like me, the very first thing you do after buying a new Monster is check the text on the back, there's always a short paragraph describing what inspired the creation of the flavour. But on Aussie Style Lemonade, it's strangely secretive about what this is supposed to be. It describes "Fresh citrus flavour"; but never goes into detail about what citrus fruit specifically. The ingredients list doesn't help either. My best guess is that the flavour is supposed to imitate grape fruit and lime. Both being fruits that I don't personally like. It's tart, but not in a particularly good way. Before I even put my lips to the can, it already tastes like I've bitten into a lime that's 2 months from being ripe. I think I might just be missing a certain taste gene or something, Because I know people who go crazy for this drink, But for me, It's just not there. Or maybe, like with many things in life, it's an acquired taste? It's a reminder that for as how much I can describe what something tastes like, how "good" it is, that will always be subjective. So while for me, this drink will be hard to finish, you might just adore it. "When life gives you lemons, throw them in the ocean"

<h3>Monster Energy Lewis Hamilton (Review)</h3>
It's no secret that I really like Monster Energy, and every time I get the chance to buy a new flavour that I haven't tasted yet, I jump on it. Despite this, my encyclopedia of monster tastes is small compared to the actual library of flavours out there. My research is limited by the decisions of local shop owners around my town to feature any given monster flavour.
Regardless, I am confident that this has to be the first Monster ever created that is based of an actual living person. I'm not sure why Monster had to go and give that title to a racecar driver of all people, But at least the one they picked was in addition to a car racer, a handsome vegan, philanthropist. It's just a shame that unlike the career of Mr. Sir Lewis Hamilton, himself; The flavour of this Monster is very lacking. If I had to compare this flavour to any other Monster I've reviewed so far; It would no doubt have to be Ultra Watermelon. It being sugarless works against it, because the fruit flavour they were going for (That would be Peach and Nectarine, btw) was not enough to save the drink by itself. I've always thought making drinks like this sugarless is just a waste of time, It never tastes as good as it could if they had just used traditional sweeteners. I can see why someone would want a sugar-free drink. But if it's going to taste this boring, like, what's the point, y'know? in most cases Monster manages to pull their flavours into greatness even when they are sugarless. That's a thing I've praised them for in the past. But Lewis Hamilton is a rare instance of failure. If you're a fan of Peach and Nectarine, You might still like this. Taste is obviously subjective.
Lastly I would like to say something nice about Monster Energy Lewis Hamilton, for once. I enjoy the design on the can. The pattern is obviously inspired by modern sportswear and it's very well executed. the stickers on the left side are great too. That's all I have to say, though. so let's finish of with a score of

<h3>Monster Energy ZERO SUGAR Ultra Watermelon (Review)</h3>
Products with supposed "watermelon" flavour never actually taste like watermelon, I feel. it tastes like A melon. but not watermelon specifically, I dunno, maybe it's really accurate, but I've been eating the wrong type of water melon my whole life. This tastes good enough. though, I must confess, It gets a bit bland after the first few sips. It being Sugar free works against it, in this case. because I'd like for it to be a bit sweeter. even though the other sugar free monsters never had a problem of not being sweet enough. if this was a JUICED Monster, I could easily see this being 7 out of 10. or even 8 but alas.
For as much as I'm bashing on it, though. It's not actually not that awful. If you like artificial watermelon flavour this might be for you.
but me personally, I'm not going to buy it again.

<h3>Monster Ultra Fiesta Mango (Review)</h3>
Clearly, Someone at Monster didn't get the memo that they already had a Mango flavoured drink themed after Mexican festivals. You don't need to even drink it to tell that it's going to be similar to Monster Energy Juiced Mango Loco. And it is. The most noticeable different between the two is that Mango Loco, and other Juiced monsters, As I understand it, are made from real fruits. Where as Ultra is just artificial flavours blended together. This of course gives the Juiced Monsters an extra edge in the race. Although, I reckon they're probably more expensive to produce, too. I wouldn't go so far to say that Mango loco is a loss leader. But with the variety of different fruits they put in that thing, there price tag doesn't look so unreasonable anymore.
Ultra fiesta on the other hand. It's more like they poured mango perfume into a vat of unflavoured energy drink. It doesn't taste bad. Not by any stretch of the imagination. But if I may be so bold as to compare it to a drink I last had almost a whole month ago. It's generally less rich in flavour. I find that It's hard to come up with a good reason to buy this monster. When Mango Loco is basically the same thing but better. The price is the same. And in my experience. Mango Loco is sold in more stores. So the Million dollar question is; Why does Monster Ultra Fiesta mango even exist? The only reason I can  see for someone buying this, Is if they try to avoid Sugary drinks. Which is a valid excuse. But no other Juiced Monster has their own sugar-free version in Ultra, so why? It's strange. Ultra Fiesta Mango tastes good. But I can't think of a good reason why I would recommend it to someone. I know I sound like a broken record. But it's basically just a worse version of something that already exists. If you want mango, just buy Mango Loco.

<h3>Monster Energy Ultra Peachy Keen (Review)</h3>
At first when setting out to buy this monster I was reluctant to do so. to me, Simply, the fact that this monster was Peach flavour was enough to raise a flag. Two of the four peach flavoured Monsters I've tasted both taste mid. Those being Lewis Hamilton (The blue one). and Nitro Cosmic Peach. On the other hand, though. Juiced Monarch and this Monster are two I quite Enjoy. And as you'd expect, they taste very similar. I don't have the liberty of having them both on my desk simultaneously. So I can't compare them directly to each other, to point out minute differences, but if i had to say anything, I think Juiced Monarch is better. It's a waste of time to just compare it to another drink anyway. So let me just describe the taste. It's unusually smooth and the flavour feels less like it's integrated to the beverage itself, It's kind of like just slightly carbonated water with a Peachy after-taste. Which can definitely be a good thing, because it means the flavour doesn't overstay it's welcome. The design on the can gets me in the moon to do hallucinogenic drugs.
Much like justice. This drink is best served cold.

<h3>Monster Energy Ultra Rosá (Review)</h3>
This is one of those Monsters that sits in the indescribable middle of the monster energy flavour circle. It doesn't taste like any fruit in particular. At least not any that I can personally pinpoint. The name makes me think it's supposed to taste like roses. But I've never been the type of guy to go around tasting random flowers. So if you wanna know if this drink really has a "floral Finnish" ,as they say. Go ask a botanist. The drink kind of tastes like Ultra Strawberry Dreams, but less flavourful, somehow. it's sour, but not in the way regular Monster Energy is, So if you're not a fan of the usual chemical energy drink taste, you might still like this. 
I would also like to add that around 2 hour after drinking this, Much to my surprise, I began to harbour minuscule red rose thorns on the back of my hands. I have no idea what could have caused this, but later that same day when I was washing my hands I felt a striking pain. The crimson thorns had broke of the back, and was now impaling the rest of my hand, probably from me rubbing my hands to clean them. They're like a thousand tiny needles with a stinging pain every time I moved my fingers. In an effort to get the thorns out of my hand I tried to wash away them with more water. But, woe is me. The thorns only grew larger from this digging deeper into my skin. at this point I was profusely sweating. I went to wipe away the sweat from my brow, but this only made the needles move to my face as well. Not only that. but after waking up the next day I noticed that my finger nails had turned into rose petals. and my hair, or what used to be my hair. It was now not but a tangled mess of rose vines. Safe to say, I've had a pretty unusual day. 
If anyone else has experienced something like this please let me know. My doctor doesn't believe my anecdote, and says it's most likely just the common cold.
Anyhow, there's no reason to think these rose themed symptoms have anything to do with or are in anyway related to be having drunk Monster Energy Ultra Rosá. So I'll give this drink a

<h3>Monster Energy JUICED Mango Loco (Review)</h3>
The ingredients are: Mango, Guava, Apple, Grape, Pineapple, Apricot, Peach, Orange, Passion fruit. with tropical ingredients like this it would be easy for it to fall right in line with the other millions of exotic drinks out there. but surprisingly. It doesn't taste like any other drink I know of. If i had to pin it down. I'd say that it's mostly thanks to the mango and guava. they stand out the most in the flavour. compared to other Monsters. this almost feels like it's just a regular drink. it's not highly carbonated or sour like other energy drinks. which I guess I should have expected from it being a Juice-based drink. I don't know if the caffine percentage is different in the "JUICED" line, but my heart doesn't beat nearly as rapidly when this is my energy drink of choice. maybe that's just a trick of the flavour, though. Anyhow. this is a good drink. and you can get it at pretty much every store you find regular Monster energy, so I'd say I recommend this.</p>

<h3>Monster Energy Ultra Strawberry Dreams (Review)</h3>
Much like the other Ultra Monsters, It's not exceptionally flavourful. At first when I drank this I barely detected any strawberry flavour at all, It's there, don't get me wrong the flavour is there. it's just not as noticeable as i'd like. It mostly tastes like a lighter version of regular monster. the name, can art, and lore text, they would all lead to to believe It's sweet. which it isn't really. As with most Ultra monsters. I think it could have been so much better if it wasn't Sugar free. but being sugar free is the whole point of the Ultra monsters, so alas. I drink this succulent beverage with a slight bit of disappointment.
Despite it's flaws, though. It still tastes really good. this sounds like it's completely contradictory to all my complaints about it. but you'd really have to drink it yourself to understand. It's delicious despite being not very flavourful, 
This is a weird drink. Anyhow, this is probably one of the best Ultra monsters,

<h3>Monster Energy Juiced Monarch (Review)</h3>
When the uninitiated hear Monster they imagine that tart super chemical-y flavour that you so often get with most energy drinks. But us scholars who study and appreciate these carefully crafted beverages see something very different In Monster Energy. Monster is not just drinks that make you feel awake in the morning or give you heart palpitations at 2am. It's a rich and beautiful library of the most delicious tastes ever known to men.
No other Monster encapsulates this quite as well as Monarch. It's not my favourite one, not by a long shot. But it sets a standard for what a good drink really is. Those of you readers who think Monster Energy is just another over-hyped energy drink I urge you to try Monster Energy Juiced Monarch. It's the perfect drink for a spring afternoon, It makes my heart feel warm, even though I'm dead inside. It's all around a pretty good monster.

<h3>Monster Energy Juiced Bad Apple (Review) </h3>
Over the years I've drank quite the respectable amount of Monster, And if I had bothered to write down statistics. <b>You</b> shouldn't be surprised to see that Bad Apple wi<b>ll</b> probably be among the ones I've bought the most of. It's only been released in my area since last year. <b>Never</b> the less,  it <b>see</b>ms this has sort of become a favourite of. mine. If you ask <b>me</b>. The taste is amazing. It's sour in the way that apples you get from random trees in the forest are. It's sweet, which I appreciate. but I'm glad the sourness is the main focus. <b>Coming</b> to think of it, the can says it also has kiwi fruit in it? That may very well be a contributing factor. When holding the can. <b>You'll</b> probably <b>see</b> the not to subtle theme <b>that</b> this monster has. The drink is very clearly encouraging consumers such as <b>my</b>self to commit sin! That's right! Monster energy is trying to turn their fans to satanism and crime! It's important to be <b>mind</b>ful of that fact when you're admiring the design that <b>is</b> on the can. As if you're not careful you might get coaxed into doing adultery. or possibly something worse like jaywalking. For me personally, It's <b>too</b> late. I've already committed five bank robberies just today. The flavour is absolutely worth that risk, though. This is a Monster I very much recommend, Monsters are going out <b>fast</b>er and faster these days. So grab one before the inevitably stop selling them for good like they did with my sweet sweet Pacific Punch, <b>for</b> shame... Also I have to give it to the design team on this one. I can't take my <b>eyes</b> of the red colour they used<b>.</b> It just looks so good. I don't give points based on design though. So It's staying at a not shabby </p>

<h3>Monster Energy JUICED Khaotic (Review)</h3>

I have a hard time describing what it tastes like exactly. it's fruity and extremely sweet. it's the same flavour as you get from when you've eaten a whole bowl of candy in an afternoon.
it reminds me very much of Pacific Punch. and functions well as a substitute for that. as that one can be quite hard to find these days. It's not as good pacific punch. but they have the same vibe.

Also, It goes without saying, but the art on this can is absolutely beautiful. It get's a gold star just for that
very yummy</p>

<h3>Monster Energy Ultra Gold (Review)</h3>
This is unequivocally the best Ultra Monster I have ever tasted, probably the best Ultra out there if I were hazard to guess. It's so good that it even Rivals non Ultra flavour like Pacific Punch and other Juiced Monsters. Or...?
Full disclosure, my opinion of Ultra gold may or may not be heavily swayed by my strong bias towards anything Pineapple. To be totally honest, I'm not even sure what I'm going to rate this. I love this flavour, but is that just because I was predisposed to liking it from the moment I realised It was Pineapple flavour, and is in reality only on par with Ultra Strawberry Dreams? Or is it really as good as my heart is telling me. I'm not sure that I can be a fair judge. For the past 21 day of my life making a career out of reviewing Monster Flavours just like this. To inform and entertain the Citizens of this country with accurately objective reviews on Monster Energy Drinks. Today I've met a cross in the road, Will I deceive my thousands of loyal readers by serving possibly biased reviews? No! I will do what's right. Instead of reviewing this myself. I call upon you; My rival reviewers to take upon you the burden of reviewing Monster Energy Ultra Gold! I am not proud to be leaving such an anticipated Monster Review in the hands of Inferior journalist. But to retain my integrity as the worlds best Mansysite.org Monster Energy Reviewist, That is the path I must go down. Not just for myself. but for the world at large. So please, just this once, why not turn the table? YOU Tell ME if this Monster It's really Bussin. or if it's just Mid. If that is even a favour I am allowed to ask. To all my loyal readers, I am sorry. I have let you down.... Damn this tastes good though.
