<h3>Monster Energy ZERO SUGAR Ultra Watermelon (Review)</h3>
Products with supposed "watermelon" flavour never actually taste like watermelon, I feel. it tastes like A melon. but not watermelon specifically, I dunno, maybe it's really accurate, but I've been eating the wrong type of water melon my whole life. This tastes good enough. though, I must confess, It gets a bit bland after the first few sips. It being Sugar free works against it, in this case. because I'd like for it to be a bit sweeter. even though the other sugar free monsters never had a problem of not being sweet enough. if this was a JUICED Monster, I could easily see this being 7 out of 10. or even 8 but alas.
For as much as I'm bashing on it, though. It's not actually not that awful. If you like artificial watermelon flavour this might be for you.
but me personally, I'm not going to buy it again.

<h3>Monster Energy JUICED Mango Loco (Review)</h3>
The ingredients are: Mango, Guava, Apple, Grape, Pineapple, Apricot, Peach, Orange, Passion fruit. with tropical ingredients like this it would be easy for it to fall right in line with the other millions of exotic drinks out there. but surprisingly. It doesn't taste like any other drink I know of. If i had to pin it down. I'd say that it's mostly thanks to the mango and guava. they stand out the most in the flavour. compared to other Monsters. this almost feels like it's just a regular drink. it's not highly carbonated or sour like other energy drinks. which I guess I should have expected from it being a Juice-based drink. I don't know if the caffine percentage is different in the "JUICED" line, but my heart doesn't beat nearly as rapidly when this is my energy drink of choice. maybe that's just a trick of the flavour, though. Anyhow. this is a good drink. and you can get it at pretty much every store you find regular Monster energy, so I'd say I recommend this.</p>

<h3>Monster Energy Ultra Strawberry Dreams (Review)</h3>
Much like the other Ultra Monsters, It's not exceptionally flavourful. At first when I drank this I barely detected any strawberry flavour at all, It's there, don't get me wrong the flavour is there. it's just not as noticeable as i'd like. It mostly tastes like a lighter version of regular monster. the name, can art, and lore text, they would all lead to to believe It's sweet. which it isn't really. As with most Ultra monsters. I think it could have been so much better if it wasn't Sugar free. but being sugar free is the whole point of the Ultra monsters, so alas. I drink this succulent beverage with a slight bit of disappointment.
Despite it's flaws, though. It still tastes really good. this sounds like it's completely contradictory to all my complaints about it. but you'd really have to drink it yourself to understand. It's delicious despite being not very flavourful, 
This is a weird drink. Anyhow, this is probably one of the best Ultra monsters,

<h3>Monster Energy JUICED Khaotic (Review)</h3>

I have a hard time describing what it tastes like exactly. it's fruity and extremely sweet. it's the same flavour as you get from when you've eaten a whole bowl of candy in an afternoon.
it reminds me very much of Pacific Punch. and functions well as a substitute for that. as that one can be quite hard to find these days. It's not as good pacific punch. but they have the same vibe.

Also, It goes without saying, but the art on this can is absolutely beautiful. It get's a gold star just for that
very yummy</p>
